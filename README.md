# Rainfall-Prediction-using-Neural-Networks
This project predicts rainfall trends across India for the next 10 years using deep learning models: Feedforward Backpropagation Neural Network (FBNN) and NARX-LSTM. It uses historical rainfall data to build a forecasting system for climate analysis, agriculture planning, and disaster preparedness.
